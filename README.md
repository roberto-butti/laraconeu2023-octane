## Laravel Octane: the Nitro for your Web

Laravel is much more than a framework.

Laravel is an ecosystem (supported by a large community) with tools, services, and libraries that enable Web applicationsâ€™ design, development, release, and evolution.

Today, there is much talk about performant, scalable, fast applications that can support many concurrent users and, consequently, many concurrent requests.

In the Laravel ecosystem, the Laravel Octane tool allows us to optimize applications through techniques such as reusing instances of framework objects, asynchronous execution, setting up storage mechanisms (Swoole Table), and caching.

During the talk, the use of Laravel Octane in a web application will be shown in the installation, configuration, implementation, and use of asynchronous mechanisms.

In addition, the implications and steps to be taken to effectively use Laravel Octane to avoid memory leaks and deadlock problems will be shown.
